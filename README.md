# BouncingDvdLogo
Image of 'dvd video' logo commonly moving around screen bouncing off edges, with the main focus being "when will it hit the corner !"

# Future Development
- when in corner detection if corner - the reaction from the tv show 'the office us' will play
- a calaculation to next corner hit displayed on screen
- time calculations from last to next hit
- better color options and speed variance also different logos perhaps
